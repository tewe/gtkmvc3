# In this example the use of observable properties is shown.
# Somethimes the models are interested in thriggering actions into
# observers when a certain event occurs, e.g. when the model changes
# status, but it is not important to hold the new status.  In these
# situations, classical observable properties are not useful, and
# version 1.0.0 adds "signals" as special kind of observable
# properties. The example shows how signals can be used.

Test should print:
Signal! <id 1> None
