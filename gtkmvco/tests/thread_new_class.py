# In this example the use of observable properties is shown.  In the
# other example 'existing_object' an already defined (and
# instantiated) object was observed. Instead, in this example we want
# to develop a class that represents an observable object by
# construction, i.e. designed to be integrated in the observable
# pattern of gtkmvc3. This can be easily achieved by deriving our class
# from the Observable base class, and by declaring the methods that we
# want to monitor (for example, those that change the class instance)
# by using a decorator.

Test should print:
